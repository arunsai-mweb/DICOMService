4. Check the system if it is 32 bit or 64 bit OS
   
   If the system is 32 bit, copy 
   	32 Bit OpenSSL Folder Contents from D:\ClientApp\Packages\OpenSSL-Win32 folder to D:\ClientApp\Application\OpenSSL folder

   If the system is 64 bit, copy 
	64 Bit  OpenSSL Folder Contents from D:\ClientApp\Packages\OpenSSL-Win64 folder to D:\ClientApp\Application\OpenSSL folder
	
   
   Open D:\ClientApp\Application\OpenSSL\bin folder.
   
   Run openssl.exe in administation mode.
   
   Create a key and certificate for enabling the tls functionality.

   For key generation enter the following command with the key name as:
             genrsa -out client.key 2048    
	
   For certificate generation enter the following command with the name as:
             req -config openssl.cfg -new -x509 -key client.key -out client.crt
			 
   It will ask some personnal details please enter.
   
   Now a pair of client.key and client.crt will be generated.
   
   cut or copy both the files and paste it outside the folder in D:\ClientApp\Application
   
   And the "client.crt" should be placed both at the ClientApp and DestinationApp for the verification.
   Can read the destination app instructions for further details.
