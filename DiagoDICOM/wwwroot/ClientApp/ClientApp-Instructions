4. Check the system if it is 32 bit or 64 bit OS
     If the system is 32 bit
   	    Install 32 Bit VC_redist.x86 from D:\ClientApp\Packages\VC 
	   
	    Open 32 Bit OpenSSL Folder
	   
	    Open D:\ClientApp\Application\OpenSSL\bin folder.
   
        Run openssl.exe in administation mode.
        
        Create a key and certificate for enabling the tls functionality.
        
        For key generation enter the following command with the key name as:
                  genrsa -out client.key 2048    
	     
        For certificate generation enter the following command with the name as:
                  req -config openssl.cfg -new -x509 -key client.key -out client.crt
